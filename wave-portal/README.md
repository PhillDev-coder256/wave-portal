The Wave Portal is a fully functional decentralized application (DApp) built on the Ethereum Sepolia testnet. It serves as a comprehensive demonstration of a modern Web3 workflow, from smart contract development to a polished, user-centric frontend. Users can connect their crypto wallets and send a "wave" with a message, which is then permanently recorded on the blockchain.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Wallet Integration:** Seamlessly connect to MetaMask or other Web3 wallets.
*   **On-Chain Interactions:** Send a message via a state-changing transaction (`wave`) that is recorded on the Sepolia testnet.
*   **Real-Time UI Updates:** The application listens for `NewWave` events from the smart contract, allowing the list of waves to update in real-time across all clients without needing a page refresh.
*   **Professional UX/UI:**
    *   **Non-Blocking Notifications:** Uses `react-hot-toast` to provide feedback on transaction status (sending, mining, success, failure) without disruptive popups.
    *   **Loading States:** The UI provides clear visual feedback while transactions are being processed.
    *   **Data Formatting:** Addresses are truncated and timestamps are displayed in a user-friendly format (e.g., "2 minutes ago").
*   **On-Chain Spam Protection:** The smart contract enforces a 15-minute cooldown period per address to prevent spam.

## Local Development

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18 or later)
*   MetaMask browser extension
*   An Alchemy account for a Sepolia API key

### 1. Smart Contract Setup

The smart contract and frontend are in separate directories within this repository. First, set up the contract.

```bash
# Navigate to the contract directory
cd wave-portal

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create a .env file and add your Alchemy API URL and private key
# See .env.example for the required format

Deploy the contract to the Sepolia testnet
